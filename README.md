# Singularity Docker

This repository serves Dockerized Singularity, organized by versions that
are currently installed from the Singularity main repository (based on
versioned branches).

## Versions

See the [master branch](https://github.com/singularityhub/singularity-docker) for a complete list of versions, and the  [singularityware/singularity](https://hub.docker.com/r/singularityware/singularity/) repository on Docker Hub.

## Use Cases

Currently, the intended use case is to provide these as base images for continuous
integration, meaning that you should be able to build a container using one of
these environments.
